# MIDI Board
A MIDI board uses buttons and pentiometers to create music in software! It is a device that makes making music easier.

# Final Milestone

I completed my final milestone by sealing up the box and touching up my code. After sealing it up I ran into a little bit of a problem. The MIDI board wasn't working! Due to this issue I had to re-open the entire box and fix the problem. The problem was that the wires were't staying in the breadboard and because I couldn't solder the breadboard I used male and female jumper wires to make it more stirdy then the breadboard wires I had been using before.

# Second Milestone

My second milestone is that I have sucessfully soldered all of the wires, strongly securing the wire to the potentiometers and the buttons. I have also found a software, serato studio, that supports my MIDI board and allows it to make music. A problem I ran into was that since this was my first time soldering I didn't realize that you shouldn't solder anything to the breadboard. Since I made this mistake I had to flip the breadboard around because the solder was bridging the 5v and GND rails.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was achieved after I had connected all of the wires from the arduino to the buttons and potentiometers. I had connected all of the wires inside the frame of my box. After the wiring was done I worked on my code which allowed me to use hairless serial bridge and loopMIDI. I was stuck at this stage for a while because I was having trouble when it came to finding a music software that supported my custom MIDI board.
